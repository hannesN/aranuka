_Aranuka_ maps Java POJOs to topics of a topic map. It provides a set of annotations
and a facility to use and configure _Aranuka_. It does not provide its own Topic Maps engine.
Instead it uses connectors which use a specific Topic Maps engine. Currently _Aranuka_ provides 
three conntectors:

* tinyTiM Connector
* Ontopia Database Connector
* Ontopia Memory Connector

To use _Aranuka_ it is necessary to use one of the connectors.

NOTE: The database connector is still experiemental.
