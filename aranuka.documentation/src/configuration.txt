== Using _Aranuka_ ==

=== Configuration ===

After annotating the domain model _Aranuke_ needs some configuration parameters to create a session.
This configuration is done with an instance of *de.topicmapslab.aranuka.Configuration*.


----
Configuration conf = new Configuration();
----

After instantiating the configuration it is necessary to add all annotated classes to the configuration, like:

----
conf.addClass(Person.class);
---- 

The next step is to set some properties for the topic map. Configuration properties are:

* IProperties.CONNECTOR_CLASS the qualified name of the connector class to use
* IProperties.BASE_LOCATOR the base locator for the topic map
* IProperties.BACKEND which backend should be used
** _memory_ configures the connector to use a memory backend
** _db_ configures the connector to use a memory backend

Backends which support the memory backend need the property:

*  IProperties.FILENAME filename for the serialization.

The database backends need informations about the connection. The properties are:

* IProperties.DATABASESYSTEM This property tells _Aranuka_ which database management system is used. Valid values are:
** mysql
** postgresql
** h2
* IProperties.DATABASE_HOST the host where the DBMS is running
* IProperties.DATABASE_PORT the port the DBMS is listening
* IProperties.DATABASE_NAME the name of the database
* IProperties.DATABASE_LOGIN the login for the database
* IProperties.DATABASE_PASSWORD the password of the database

NOTE: Right now MaJorToM supports only posgresql.

NOTE: Ontopia  is able to connect to much more DBMS. It is possible to configure the engine using the 
its own properties. If the property "net.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.Database" is found the
MaJorToM properties will be ignored. For more information refer to the Ontopia docs.

----
conf.setProperty(IProperties.CONNECTOR_CLASS, "de.topicmapslab.aranuka.tinytim.connectors.TinyTiMConnector");
conf.setProperty(IProperties.BASE_LOCATOR, "http://docs.aranuka.de/documentation/");

---- 

NOTE: It is possible to load the property files from a file and set them at once using the method: 
*conf.setProperties(properties)*

If qnames were used to specify the identifiers for the types the qname identifier, called prefix, and the URI should be
set to the configuration. It is also possible to specify new prefixes which will be used for identifiers of the prefixes.
Add a prefix definition like:

----
conf.addPrefix("tp", "http://test.de/");
---- 

NOTE: The base locator is used to resolve the prefix 'base_locator'. If another prefix is desired it is possible to overwrite the
prefix by adding a new prefix with the base locator URI.

The memory connectors of _Aranuka_ store their topic maps into a file. This can be either XTM or CTM. The filename is also set in the configuration:

------------
conf.setProperty(IProperties.FILENAME, "/path/to/file.ctm");
------------

NOTE: The serializer is chosen based on the file suffix. If it's 'ctm' the ctm serializer is used. If it's 'xtm' the xtm2.0 serializer is used.

It is possible to change the filename property after the session is created. This means the topic map is stored in the new file overwrting any existent
file.


==== Naming the types ====

Every type used in the annotations only has a subject identifier. For a easier understanding of the type, the user might want to add
names to the types. This is possible via the configuration. 
---------------
conf.addName(id, name)
---------------  

Alternatively create a map and fill it using the subject identifier of the type as key
and its name as value. After filling the map add it to the configuration with:
---------------
conf.setNameMap(nameMap)
--------------- 

NOTE: If you use setNameMap all names put in the configuration via addName will be overwritten.

=== Session ===

After the configuration is finished a session can be retrieved from the configuration instance:

--------
conf.getSession(false);
--------

The parameter asks if the classes annotations should be parsed before creating the session (*false*) or lazy when the class is used the first time (*true*).

NOTE: If the filename of the configuration points to an existing topic map it will be loaded and the topics.

==== Persist Topics ====

To persist an instance of an annotated class the session class provides the method persist.
Every instance must have a property annotated with *Id*. Persist checks if a topic identified by  
the value of this property exists and updates the other properties and association according to the 
values of the instance. If no topic exists a new one is created. 

==== Retrieve Topics ====

Of course it is possible to get instances from the topic map. The session provides two ways to retrieve an instance
from the topic map. The first retrieves all instances from a specific type. The method:

-------
getAll(Class<?> clazz)
-------

The parameter of this method is the class object of the annotated class. This method returns a set of instances which 
represent the topics of that type.


The other way is to retrieve a instance by identifier. The session provides three methods one for each kind of Topic Maps 
identifier and returns either *null* if no topic with the given identifier exists or the instance representing the topic.

--------------
getByItemIdentifier(String)
getBySubjectIdentifier(String)
getBySubjectLocator(String)
-------------- 

NOTE: The given identifier must be resolved. QNames are not allowed at the moment.

==== Persist the Topic Map ====

The session provides the following method:
---------
flushTopicMap()
---------

The memory connectors serialize the file according to the filename set in the configuration.

==== Clear the Topic Map ====

With version 1.0.1 _Aranuka_ provides a method to clear the topic map inside the session. This can come handy especially in unit tests.
To clear the method call:
-------------
clearTopicMap()
-------------
