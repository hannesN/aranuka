Preface
=======

Aranuka is a framework which allows user to persist information stored in Java objects into a topic map 
without the need to implement the necessary calls to the used Topic Maps Engine. The mapping between the Java model and the topic map is defined
directly in the related model classes via Java-Annotation. The Annotations hold all information needed by Aranuka which makes it very easy to use Aranuka with an existing
model or to change the model or mapping.

This documentation describes the general concept and architecture of Aranuka as well as shows how to use it and provides tutorials.
